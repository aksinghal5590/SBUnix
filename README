***************************50 Point Project*************************************

***************************System Calls*****************************************

All function prototype declared in include/ are implemented.

***************************Test Cases******************************************
1. For cd:
	i. do ls
	ii. do cd <dir-name>
	iii. do ls
	Example: cd bin; ls; cd ..; ls
cd supports ".." but not nested "..". Example- cd does not support ../..

2. For ls:
	i. do ls
	ii. Print out all absolute path-name of all sub-directories and files.

Default: ls without argument will print current directory structure.

3. For Sleep:
	i. Sleep system call waits for given number of seconds.
	ii. Sleep call is used in sbush.c where if user provide any command, then after executing the command, the process will sleep for 2 seconds[Default]

4. For running script:
	i. Either provide absolute path of script or it will take the relative path from the current directory.
	Example: For testing purpose, there is a script inside test/test.sh. On the terminal, ./test/test.sh and it will perform the commands inside it. In our example, the contents of test/test.sh is cd bin/ and ls.

5. For kill:
	i. kill -9 <pid> is supported. If anything apart from "-9" is used, the command is invalid. If the given pid is not present, then error is thrown. If sbush is killed, then we are again loading sbush from init without printing any error.

6. Terminal:
	i. Terminal supports typing of characters at run-time and backspace. However, cursor position is not set properly and it may be misleading.

7. cat:
	i. cat <filename>. <filename> can be absolute path or relative path from current directory.

8. echo:
	i. For echo, apart from normal functionality, $PWD is also supported.Otherwise, no environment variable is supported.
